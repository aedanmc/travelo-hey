# Bug/Issue Tracking

Travelo-Hey! uses GitHub Issues to track current issues and bugs relating to different aspects of the project.

## How to submit a bug for tracking

From the [main repository website](https://github.com/aedanmc/travelo-hey) 

1. Navigate to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/aedanmc/travelo-hey/issues). 

2. Observe the list of open issues displayed and identify whether the issue you want to identify to the team has already been documented.

3. If the bug or issue has been identified already and you want to provide additional information, choose the bug from the list of open issues and add a comment following the format described in [Bug Documentation Guidelines](#bug-documentation-guidelines).

4. If the bug or issue has not yet been identified, press the button labeled "New Issue".

5. After the page loads, write a short but descriptive title that explains what the bug is.

6. In the box below the title, follow the guidelines mentioned in [Bug Documentation Guidelines](#bug-documentation-guidelines).


## Bug Documentation Guidelines

Use the bullet points below as a template for how to write helpful bug reports:
- The location/webpage where you discovered the bug
- The behavior you expected to see
- The behavior you actually saw
- A sequence of steps taken to reproduce the bug, if you can.
- If the steps to produce the bug are not clear to you, provide as much information as you can in 3 sentences about the bug and the state of the program when you encountered it.
