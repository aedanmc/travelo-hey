# Travelo-Hey! User Guide

Welcome to Travelo-Hey!! Our solution consists of a web application that allows users to search for and review different locations around the world. 

Our primary goals for this web app are to help LGBTQ+ travelers do the following things:
- Find safe places to visit while traveling, and 
- Get an overall sense of how safe it is to travel in a given country given differing countries' level of openness towards LGBTQ+ people.

We support these goals by giving users an equality rating for each location we include in our app that we generate based on several metrics relating to how open a location (business, country, etc) is to LGBTQ+ individuals, especially those who are from abroad. 


# Installation and Running Travelo-Hey!

As Travelo-Hey! is a web app, all that is required is JavaScript on either Chrome or Firefox. We are hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, so all you need to get started is to simply navigate to this link (**LINK TBD**)! If you want to run our development build, see our [build instructions] (link to developer guide's build and run instructions)

### Getting started

To start looking at locations and gathering information for your next trip,
you have a few options. From the landing page, you can either start searching for a location. You can also look at some of the places the Travelo-Hey! team features from the start by clicking on any of the location cards visible.

### Searching for a location

Work in progress! This feature will be part of our final release, but is not yet operational.

### Viewing a location's equality rating

Either by searching (work in progress) or just from one of Travelo-Hey!'s featured locations, click on a card displaying a business's profile image, name, phone number, and address. From there, our equality rating is displayed on the screen along with some reviews taken from Google's database of users.

### Viewing a country's overall safety rating

Work in progress! This feature will be part of our final release, but is not yet operational.
