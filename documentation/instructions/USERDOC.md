# Travelo-Hey! User Guide

Welcome to Travelo-Hey!! Our solution consists of a web application that allows users to search for and review different locations around the world. 

Our primary goals for this web app are to help LGBTQ+ travelers do the following things:
- Find safe places to visit while traveling, and 
- Get an overall sense of how safe it is to travel in a given country given differing countries' level of openness towards LGBTQ+ people.

We support these goals by giving users an equality rating for each location we include in our app that we generate based on several metrics relating to how open a location (business, country, etc) is to LGBTQ+ individuals, especially those who are from abroad. 


# Installation and Running Travelo-Hey!

As Travelo-Hey! is a web app, all that is required is JavaScript on either Chrome or Firefox. We are hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, so all you need to get started is to simply navigate to this link (**LINK TBD**)! If you want to run our development build, see our [build instructions] (link to developer guide's build and run instructions)

### Getting started

To start looking at locations and gathering information for your next trip,
you have a few options. From the landing page, you can either start searching for a location. You can also look at some of the places the Travelo-Hey! team features from the start by clicking on any of the location cards visible.

### Searching for a location

Searching for a location starts on the landing page using Travelo-Hey!'s filter options for country, city, and activity. Simply select at least one option from the three dropdown categories and click search. This will take you to a search results page containing locations that fit your filtered criteria. Clicking on a search result location card will take you to detailed information page and posted reviews about the location. 

### Posting a review

To post a review, start by accessing a location's specific page and scroll down below the information to the reviews section. Below the equality rating is a button labeled "Write a review". Clicking on this button will take you to a form fillout page where you can leave your review and add to the equality rating. Once filled out, click the "Submit" button on the bottom and your review will be posted on that location's page. 


### Viewing a location's equality rating

Either by searching (work in progress) or just from one of Travelo-Hey!'s featured locations, click on a card displaying a business's profile image, name, phone number, and address. From there, our equality rating is displayed on the screen along with some reviews taken from Google's database of users.

### Viewing a country's overall safety rating

Work in progress! This feature will be part of our final release, but is not yet operational.
