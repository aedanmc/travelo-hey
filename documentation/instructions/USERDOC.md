# Travelo-Hey! User Guide

Welcome to Travelo-Hey!! Our solution consists of a web application that allows users to search for and review different locations around the world. 

Our primary goals for this web app are to help LGBTQ+ travelers do the following things:
- Find safe places to visit while traveling, and 
- Get an overall sense of how safe it is to travel in a given country given differing countries' level of openness towards LGBTQ+ people.

We support these goals by giving users an equality rating for each location we include in our app that we generate based on several metrics relating to how open a location (business, country, etc) is to LGBTQ+ individuals, especially those who are from abroad. 

Given that this web app is intended for a group of users who are often targeted on account of their identity, please review our guidelines for using the app (add link to community guidelines).

### Getting started

To start looking at locations and gathering information for your next trip,
you have a few options. From the landing page, you can either start searching for a location. You can also look at some of the places the Travelo-Hey! team features from the start by clicking on any of the location cards visible.

### Searching for a location

Work in progress! This feature will be part of our final release, but is not yet operational.

### Viewing a location's equality rating

Either by searching (work in progress) or just from one of Travelo-Hey!'s featured locations, click on a card displaying a business's profile image, name, phone number, and address. From there, our equality rating is displayed on the screen along with some reviews taken from Google's database of users.

### Viewing a country's overall safety rating
